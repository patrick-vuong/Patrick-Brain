# Copilot Instructions for Patrick-Brain Repository

## For All Agents and Developers

### Tech Stack Documentation Workflow

When working on React web application projects or making tech stack decisions:

1. **ALWAYS start with [TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md](TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md)**
   - This is your "north star" guide with quick references and decision flowcharts
   - Contains one-line mental models, Quick Start Stack, and key decision guides
   - Designed to fit in a single context window for efficient agent operation

2. **Only consult [TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md](TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md) when you need:**
   - Detailed explanations of "why" a technology was chosen
   - Comprehensive comparisons of alternative options
   - Deep dive into specific sections (1-16)
   - Trade-off analysis for edge cases

3. **Workflow:**
   ```
   Start Planning → Read TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md → Make Initial Decisions
                                                          ↓
                                                    Need Details?
                                                          ↓
                                              Consult Specific Sections in
                                              TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md
   ```

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Efficient Context Usage**: Defaults file is concise (~150 lines) vs full reference (~630 lines)
- **Faster Decision Making**: Quick references and flowcharts enable rapid choices
- **Reduced Token Waste**: Only load detailed content when actually needed
- **Better Onboarding**: Humans and agents can quickly understand the recommended stack

### When to Read Each File

| File | When to Read | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md** | Always first, every project | Quick decisions, mental models, default stack |
| **TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md** | Only when you need details | Deep rationale, alternatives, comprehensive comparisons |

### Repository Structure Note

The original `Design Tech Stack for React Modern Web App.MD` file is maintained for historical reference but should not be used for new projects. Always use the new split structure:

- **TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md** - Your starting point
- **TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md** - Your encyclopedia

### Future Modular Organization

This repository is prepared for future modularization where the reference will be split into topic-specific files under `docs/tech-stack/`:

```
docs/
└── tech-stack/
    ├── 01-react-or-not.md
    ├── 02-prd-discovery.md
    ├── 03-scope-recommendation.md
    ├── 04-rendering-models.md
    ├── 05-infrastructure.md
    ├── 06-state-management.md
    ├── 07-styling.md
    ├── 08-routing.md
    ├── 09-api-layer.md
    ├── 10-backend.md
    ├── 11-database.md
    ├── 12-auth.md
    ├── 13-testing.md
    ├── 14-devops.md
    ├── 15-monitoring.md
    └── 16-security.md
```

This will enable:
- Easier maintenance and updates of individual topics
- Reduced context loading (read only what you need)
- Better version control (clearer diffs on specific topics)
- Parallel updates by multiple contributors

## General Repository Guidelines

### About Patrick-Brain

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and toolkit for reusable components, resources, and documentation for full-stack development projects.

### Contributing

When adding or updating documentation:
- Keep TECH_STACK_DEFAULTS.md concise and focused on quick decisions
- Add detailed content to TECH_STACK_REFERENCE.md with proper section headers
- Update both files together when recommendations change
- Maintain the decision guide flowcharts in text/ASCII format for easy reading

### Memory Storage

When working in this repository, use the `store_memory` tool to capture:
- Build and test commands that work
- Documentation conventions and styles
- Patterns for how decision guides are formatted
- Any insights about the repository structure
